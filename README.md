# Investigate-no-show-dataset
This project goes to a simple but entire data analysis process for a real dataset
It's a part of the data-analysis nanodegree offered by Udacity.

> The original data source code is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
<br>The No-Show dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on
the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
<br> you can view the data from the csv file.

## Questinos
### The process goes to answer wheather these features related to a patint's no-show:
* The duration between the schedule day and appointment day.
* chronic disease (Hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, or Handcap).
* Hospitals neighborhood (or location of the hospital).

### Conclusion
Duration is the most effective feature from the features we have analyse.
